London. A Room in the Palace.<br /><br />[Enter the King Henry, Westmoreland, Sir Walter Blunt, and<br />others.]<br /><br />KING.<br />So shaken as we are, so wan with care,<br />Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,<br />And breathe short-winded accents of new broils<br />To be commenced in strands afar remote.<br />No more the thirsty entrance of this soil<br />Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;<br />No more shall trenching war channel her fields,<br />Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs<br />Of hostile paces:  those opposed eyes,<br />Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,<br />All of one nature, of one substance bred,<br />Did lately meet in the intestine shock<br />And furious close of civil butchery,<br />Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,<br />March all one way, and be no more opposed<br />Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies:<br />The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,<br />No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,<br />As far as to the sepulchre of Christ--<br />Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross<br />We are impressed and engaged to fight--<br />Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,<br />To chase these pagans in those holy fields<br />Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet<br />Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd<br />For our advantage on the bitter cross.<br />But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old,<br />And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:<br />Therefore we meet not now.--Then let me hear<br />Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,<br />What yesternight our Council did decree<br />In forwarding this dear expedience.<br /><br />WEST.<br />My liege, this haste was hot in question,<br />And many limits of the charge set down<br />But yesternight; when, all athwart, there came<br />A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;<br />Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,<br />Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight<br />Against th' irregular and wild Glendower,<br />Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken;<br />A thousand of his people butchered,<br />Upon whose dead corpse' there was such misuse,<br />Such beastly, shameless transformation,<br />By those Welshwomen done, as may not be<br />Without much shame re-told or spoken of.<br /><br />KING.<br />It seems, then, that the tidings of this broil<br />Brake off our business for the Holy Land.<br /><br />WEST.<br />This, match'd with other, did, my gracious lord;<br />For more uneven and unwelcome news<br />Came from the North, and thus it did import:<br />On Holy-rood day the gallant Hotspur there,<br />Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,<br />That ever-valiant and approved Scot,<br />At Holmedon met;<br />Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,<br />As by discharge of their artillery,<br />And shape of likelihood, the news was told;<br />For he that brought them, in the very heat<br />And pride of their contention did take horse,<br />Uncertain of the issue any way.<br /><br />KING.<br />Here is a dear and true-industrious friend,<br />Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,<br />Stain'd with the variation of each soil<br />Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;<br />And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.<br />The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:<br />Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,<br />Balk'd in their own blood, did Sir Walter see<br />On Holmedon's plains:  of prisoners, Hotspur took<br />Mordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son<br />To beaten Douglas; and the Earls of Athol,<br />Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.<br />And is not this an honourable spoil,<br />A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?<br /><br />WEST.<br />Faith, 'tis a conquest for a prince to boast of.<br /><br />KING.<br />Yea, there thou makest me sad, and makest me sin<br />In envy that my Lord Northumberland<br />Should be the father to so blest a son,--<br />A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;<br />Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;<br />Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:<br />Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,<br />See riot and dishonour stain the brow<br />Of my young Harry. O, that it could be proved<br />That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged<br />In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,<br />And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!<br />Then would I have his Harry, and he mine:<br />But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,<br />Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,<br />Which he in this adventure hath surprised,<br />To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,<br />I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.<br /><br />WEST.<br />This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,  <br />Malevolent to you in all aspects;<br />Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up<br />The crest of youth against your dignity.<br /><br />KING.<br />But I have sent for him to answer this;<br />And for this cause awhile we must neglect<br />Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.<br />Cousin, on Wednesday next our Council we<br />Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:<br />But come yourself with speed to us again;<br />For more is to be said and to be done<br />Than out of anger can be uttered.<br /><br />WEST.<br />I will, my liege.<br /><br /><br />[Exeunt.]<br /><br /><br /><br />Scene II. The same. An Apartment of Prince Henry's.<br /><br />[Enter Prince Henry and Falstaff.]<br /><br />FAL.<br />Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and<br />unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches<br />after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which<br />thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the<br />time of the day? unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes<br />capons, and the blessed Sun himself a fair hot wench in<br />flame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be<br />so superfluous to demand the time of the day.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go<br />by the Moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus,--he, that<br />wandering knight so fair. And I pr'ythee, sweet wag, when thou<br />art king,--as, God save thy Grace--Majesty I should say, for<br />grace<br />thou wilt have none,--<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />What, none?<br /><br />FAL.<br />No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue<br />to an egg and butter.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that<br />are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's<br />beauty:  let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade,<br />minions of the Moon; and let men say we be men of good<br />government, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and<br />chaste mistress the Moon, under whose countenance we steal.<br /><br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Thou say'st well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of<br />us that are the Moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea,<br />being governed, as the sea is, by the Moon. As, for proof, now: A<br />purse of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night, and most<br />dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing Lay by, <br />and spent with crying Bring in; now ill as low an ebb as the foot<br />of the ladder, and by-and-by in as high a flow as the ridge of the<br />gallows.<br /><br />FAL.<br />By the Lord, thou say'st true, lad.  And is not my hostess of the<br />tavern a most sweet wench?<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle.  And is not a<br />buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?<br /><br />FAL.<br />How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and thy<br />quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?<br /><br />FAL.<br />Well, thou hast call'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?<br /><br />FAL.<br />No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;<br />and where it would not, I have used my credit.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Yea, and so used it, that, were it not here apparent that<br />thou art heir-apparent--But I pr'ythee, sweet wag, shall there be<br />gallows standing in England when thou art king? and<br />resolution thus fobb'd as it is with the rusty curb of old father<br />antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />No; thou shalt.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Thou judgest false already:  I mean, thou shalt have the<br />hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour;<br />as well as waiting in the Court, I can tell you.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />For obtaining of suits?  <br /><br />FAL.<br />Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no<br />lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib-cat or a<br />lugg'd bear.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />What say'st thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?<br /><br />FAL.<br />Thou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art, indeed, the<br />most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince,--But, Hal, I<br />pr'ythee trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and<br />I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old<br />lord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you, <br />sir,--but I mark'd him not; and yet he talk'd very wisely,--but I<br />regarded him not; and yet he talk'd wisely, and in the street too.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man<br />regards it.<br /><br />FAL.<br />O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art, indeed, able to corrupt<br />a saint.<br />Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! <br />Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man <br />should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must<br />give over this life, and I will give it over; by the Lord, an I do<br />not, I am a villain:  I'll be damn'd for never a king's son in<br />Christendom.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Where shall we take a purse to-morrow, Jack?<br /><br />FAL.<br />Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one:  an I do not, call<br />me villain, and baffle me.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />I see a good amendment of life in thee,--from praying to<br />purse-taking.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a man to labour<br />in his vocation.<br /><br />[Enter Pointz.]<br /><br />--Pointz!--Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if<br />men were to be saved by merit, what hole in Hell were hot enough<br />for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried<br />Stand! to a true man.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Good morrow, Ned.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Good morrow, sweet Hal.--What says Monsieur Remorse? what<br />says Sir John Sack-and-sugar? Jack, how agrees the Devil and<br />thee about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last<br />for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg?<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Sir John stands to his word,--the Devil shall have his bargain;<br />for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs,--he will give the<br />Devil his due.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Then art thou damn'd for keeping thy word with the Devil.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Else he had been damn'd for cozening the Devil.<br /><br /><br />POINTZ.<br />But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o'clock,<br />early at Gads-hill! there are pilgrims gong to Canterbury<br />with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat<br />purses: I have visards for you all; you have horses for<br />yourselves:  Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester:  I have bespoke<br />supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap:  we may do it as secure as<br />sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns;<br />if you will not, tarry at home and be hang'd.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you<br />for going.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />You will, chops?<br /><br />FAL.<br />Hal, wilt thou make one?  <br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.<br /><br />FAL.<br />There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee,<br />nor thou camest not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand<br />for ten shillings.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Well, then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Why, that's well said.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.<br /><br />FAL.<br />By the Lord, I'll be a traitor, then, when thou art king.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />I care not.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br /><br />Sir John, I pr'ythee, leave the Prince and me alone: I will<br />lay him down such reasons for this adventure, that he shall go.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion, and him the ears <br />of profiting, that what thou speakest may move, and what he<br />hears may be believed, that the true Prince may, for recreation-<br />sake, prove a false thief; for the poor abuses of the time want<br />countenance. Farewell; you shall find me in Eastcheap.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Farewell, thou latter Spring! farewell, All-hallown Summer!<br /><br />[Exit Falstaff.]<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Now, my good sweet honey-lord, ride with us to-morrow:  I<br />have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff,<br />Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill, shall rob those men that we have<br />already waylaid:  yourself and I will not be there; and when they<br />have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off<br />from my shoulders.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />But how shall we part with them in setting forth?<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them<br />a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and<br />then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves; which they<br />shall have no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Ay, but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our <br />habits, and by every other appointment, to be ourselves.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Tut! our horses they shall not see,--I'll tie them in the wood;<br />our visards we will change, after we leave them; and, sirrah, I<br />have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted<br />outward garments.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />But I doubt they will be too hard for us.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred<br />cowards as ever turn'd back; and for the third, if he fight<br />longer than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms. The virtue of<br />this jest will be, the incomprehensible lies that this same fat<br />rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least,<br />he fought with; what wards, what blows, what extremities he<br />endured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Well, I'll go with thee:  provide us all things necessary and<br />meet me to-night in Eastcheap; there I'll sup. Farewell.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Farewell, my lord.<br /><br />[Exit.]<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />I know you all, and will awhile uphold<br />The unyok'd humour of your idleness:<br />Yet herein will I imitate the Sun,<br />Who doth permit the base contagious clouds<br />To smother-up his beauty from the world,<br />That, when he please again to be himself,<br />Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,<br />By breaking through the foul and ugly mists<br />Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.<br />If all the year were playing holidays,<br />To sport would be as tedious as to work;<br />But, when they seldom come, they wish'd-for come,<br />And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.<br />So, when this loose behaviour I throw off,<br />And pay the debt I never promised,<br />By how much better than my word I am,<br />By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;<br />And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,<br />My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,<br />Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes<br />Than that which hath no foil to set it off.<br />I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;<br />Redeeming time, when men think least I will.<br /><br />[Exit.]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Scene III. The Same.  A Room in the Palace.<br /><br />[Enter King Henry, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur, Sir Walter<br />Blunt, and others.]<br /><br />KING.<br />My blood hath been too cold and temperate,<br />Unapt to stir at these indignities,<br />And you have found me; for, accordingly,<br />You tread upon my patience:  but be sure<br />I will from henceforth rather be myself,<br />Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,<br />Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,<br />And therefore lost that title of respect<br />Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.<br /><br />WOR.<br />Our House, my sovereign liege, little deserves<br />The scourge of greatness to be used on it;<br />And that same greatness too which our own hands<br />Have holp to make so portly.<br /><br />NORTH.<br />My good lord,--<br /><br />KING.<br />Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see<br />Danger and disobedience in thine eye:<br />O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,<br />And majesty might never yet endure<br />The moody frontier of a servant brow.<br />You have good leave to leave us:  when we need<br />Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.<br /><br />[Exit Worcester.]<br /><br />[To Northumberland.]<br /><br />You were about to speak.<br /><br />NORTH.<br />Yea, my good lord.<br />Those prisoners in your Highness' name demanded,<br />Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,<br />Were, as he says, not with such strength denied<br />As is deliver'd to your Majesty:<br />Either envy, therefore, or misprision<br />Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.<br /><br />HOT.<br />My liege, I did deny no prisoners.<br />But, I remember, when the fight was done,<br />When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,<br />Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,<br />Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dress'd,<br />Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd<br />Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home:<br />He was perfumed like a milliner;<br />And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held<br />A pouncet-box, which ever and anon<br />He gave his nose, and took't away again;<br />Who therewith angry, when it next came there,<br />Took it in snuff:  and still he smiled and talk'd;<br />And, as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,<br />He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,<br />To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse<br />Betwixt the wind and his nobility.<br />With many holiday and lady terms<br />He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded<br />My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf.<br />I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,<br />Out of my grief and my impatience<br />To be so pester'd with a popinjay,<br />Answer'd neglectingly, I know not what,--<br />He should, or he should not; for't made me mad<br />To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,<br />And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman<br />Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--<br />And telling me the sovereign'st thing on Earth<br />Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;<br />And that it was great pity, so it was,<br />This villainous salt-petre should be digg'd<br />Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,<br />Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd<br />So cowardly; and, but for these vile guns,<br />He would himself have been a soldier.<br />This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,<br />I answered indirectly, as I said;<br />And I beseech you, let not his report<br />Come current for an accusation<br />Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.<br /><br />BLUNT. <br />The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,<br />Whatever Harry Percy then had said<br />To such a person, and in such a place,<br />At such a time, with all the rest re-told,<br />May reasonably die, and never rise<br />To do him wrong, or any way impeach<br />What then he said, so he unsay it now.<br /><br />KING.<br />Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,<br />But with proviso and exception,<br />That we at our own charge shall ransom straight<br />His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;<br />Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd<br />The lives of those that he did lead to fight<br />Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,<br />Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March<br />Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,<br />Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?<br />Shall we buy treason? and indent with fears<br />When they have lost and forfeited themselves?<br />No, on the barren mountains let him starve;<br />For I shall never hold that man my friend<br />Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost<br />To ransom home revolted Mortimer.<br /><br />HOT.<br />Revolted Mortimer!<br />He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,<br />But by the chance of war:  to prove that true<br />Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,<br />Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,<br />When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,<br />In single opposition, hand to hand,<br />He did confound the best part of an hour<br />In changing hardiment with great Glendower.<br />Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,<br />Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;<br />Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,<br />Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,<br />And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank<br />Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.<br />Never did base and rotten policy<br />Colour her working with such deadly wounds;<br />Nor never could the noble Mortimer<br />Receive so many, and all willingly:<br />Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.<br /><br />KING.<br />Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;<br />He never did encounter with Glendower:<br />I tell thee,<br />He durst as well have met the Devil alone<br />As Owen Glendower for an enemy.<br />Art not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth<br />Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:<br />Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,<br />Or you shall hear in such a kind from me<br />As will displease you.--My Lord Northumberland,<br />We license your departure with your son.--<br />Send us your prisoners, or you'll hear of it.<br /><br />[Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train.]<br /><br />HOT.<br />An if the Devil come and roar for them,<br />I will not send them:  I will after straight,<br />And tell him so; for I will else my heart,<br />Although it be with hazard of my head.<br /><br />NORTH.<br />What, drunk with choler? stay, and pause awhile:<br />Here comes your uncle.<br /><br />[Re-enter Worcester.]<br /><br />HOT.<br />Speak of Mortimer!<br />Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul<br />Want mercy, if I do not join with him:<br />Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,<br />And shed my dear blood drop by drop i' the dust,<br />But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer<br />As high i' the air as this unthankful King,<br />As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.<br /><br />NORTH.<br /><br />[To Worcester.]<br /><br />Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.<br /><br />WOR.<br />Who struck this heat up after I was gone?<br /><br />HOT.<br />He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;<br />And when I urged the ransom once again<br />Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,<br />And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,<br />Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.<br /><br />WOR.<br />I cannot blame him:  was not he proclaim'd<br />By Richard that dead is the next of blood?<br /><br />NORTH.<br />He was; I heard the proclamation:<br />And then it was when the unhappy King--<br />Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth<br />Upon his Irish expedition;<br />From whence he intercepted did return<br />To be deposed, and shortly murdered.<br /><br />WOR.<br />And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth<br />Live scandalized and foully spoken of.<br /><br />HOT.<br />But, soft! I pray you; did King Richard then<br />Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer<br />Heir to the crown?<br /><br />NORTH.<br />He did; myself did hear it.<br /><br />HOT.<br />Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin King,<br />That wish'd him on the barren mountains starve.<br />But shall it be, that you, that set the crown<br />Upon the head of this forgetful man,<br />And for his sake wear the detested blot<br />Of murderous subornation,--shall it be,<br />That you a world of curses undergo,<br />Being the agents, or base second means,<br />The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?--<br />O, pardon me, that I descend so low,<br />To show the line and the predicament<br />Wherein you range under this subtle King;--<br />Shall it, for shame, be spoken in these days,<br />Or fill up chronicles in time to come,<br />That men of your nobility and power<br />Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,--<br />As both of you, God pardon it! have done,--<br />To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,<br />And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?<br />And shall it, in more shame, be further spoken,<br />That you are fool'd, discarded, and shook off<br />By him for whom these shames ye underwent?<br />No! yet time serves, wherein you may redeem<br />Your banish'd honours, and restore yourselves<br />Into the good thoughts of the world again;<br />Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt<br />Of this proud King, who studies day and night<br />To answer all the debt he owes to you<br />Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:<br />Therefore, I say,--<br /><br />WOR.<br />Peace, cousin, say no more:<br />And now I will unclasp a secret book,<br />And to your quick-conceiving discontent<br />I'll read you matter deep and dangerous;<br />As full of peril and adventurous spirit<br />As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud<br />On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.<br /><br />HOT.<br />If we fall in, good night, or sink or swim!<br />Send danger from the east unto the west,<br />So honour cross it from the north to south,<br />And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs<br />To rouse a lion than to start a hare!<br /><br />NORTH.<br />Imagination of some great exploit<br />Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.<br /><br />HOT.<br />By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,<br />To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced Moon;<br />Or dive into the bottom of the deep,<br />Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,<br />And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;<br />So he that doth redeem her thence might wear<br />Without corrival all her dignities:<br />But out upon this half-faced fellowship!<br /><br />WOR.<br />He apprehends a world of figures here,<br />But not the form of what he should attend.--<br />Good cousin, give me audience for a while.<br /><br />HOT.<br />I cry you mercy.<br /><br />WOR.<br />Those same noble Scots<br />That are your prisoners,--<br /><br />HOT.<br />I'll keep them all;<br />By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;<br />No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:<br />I'll keep them, by this hand.<br /><br />WOR.<br />You start away,<br />And lend no ear unto my purposes.<br />Those prisoners you shall keep;--<br /><br />HOT.<br />Nay, I will;

Rochester. An Inn-Yard.<br /><br />[Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand.]<br /><br />1. CAR.<br />Heigh-ho! an't be not four by the day, I'll be hang'd:<br />Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and yet our horse' not<br />pack'd.--What, ostler!<br /><br />OST.<br />[within.] Anon, anon.<br /><br />1. CAR.<br />I pr'ythee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks in the <br />point; the poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess.<br /><br />[Enter another Carrier.]<br /><br />2. CAR.<br />Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that is the<br />next way to give poor jades the bots; this house is turned<br />upside down since Robin ostler died.<br /><br />1. CAR.<br />Poor fellow! never joyed since the price of oats rose; it was <br />the death of him.<br /><br />2. CAR.<br />I think this be the most villainous house in all London road <br />for fleas:  I am stung like a tench.<br /><br />1. CAR.<br />Like a tench! by the Mass, there is ne'er a king in Christendom<br />could be better bit than I have been since the first cock.--What,<br /><br />ostler! come away and be hang'd; come away.<br /><br />2. CAR.<br />I have a gammon of bacon and two razes of ginger, to be<br />delivered as far as Charing-cross.<br /><br />1. CAR.<br />'Odsbody! the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved.--What, <br />ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou never an eye in thy head? <br />canst not hear? An 'twere not as good a deed as drink to break <br />the pate of thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hang'd: <br />hast no faith in thee?<br /><br />[Enter Gadshill.]<br /><br />GADS.<br />Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?<br /><br />1. CAR.<br />I think it be two o'clock.<br /><br />GADS.<br />I pr'ythee, lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding in the<br />stable.<br /><br />1. CAR.<br />Nay, soft, I pray ye; I know a trick worth two of that, i'faith.<br /><br />GADS.<br />I pr'ythee, lend me thine.<br /><br />2. CAR.<br />Ay, when? canst tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth a? marry, I'll <br />see thee hang'd first.<br /><br />GADS.<br />Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?<br /><br />2. CAR.<br />Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant thee.--<br />Come, neighbour Muggs, we'll call up the gentlemen:  they will<br />along with company, for they have great charge.<br /><br />[Exeunt Carriers.]<br /><br />GADS.<br />What, ho! chamberlain!<br /><br />CHAM.<br />[Within.] At hand, quoth pick-purse.<br /><br />GADS.<br />That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the chamberlain; for <br />thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving<br />direction doth from labouring; thou lay'st the plot how.<br /><br />[Enter Chamberlain.]<br /><br />CHAM.<br />Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told<br />you yesternight:  there's a franklin in the wild of Kent hath<br />brought three hundred marks with him in gold:  I heard him<br />tell it to one of his company last night at supper; a kind of<br />auditor; one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.<br />They are up already, and call for eggs and butter; they will away<br />presently.<br /><br />GADS.<br />Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks, I'll give<br />thee this neck.<br /><br />CHAM.<br />No, I'll none of it: I pr'ythee, keep that for the hangman; for<br />I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of <br />falsehood may.<br /><br />GADS.<br />What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang, I'll make<br />a fat pair of gallows; for, if I hang, old Sir John hangs with<br />me, and thou know'st he is no starveling. Tut! there are other<br />Trojans that thou dreamest not of, the which, for sport-sake,<br />are content to do the profession some grace; that would, if<br />matters should be look'd into, for their own credit-sake, make<br />all whole. I am joined with no foot land-rakers, no long-staff<br />sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued<br />malt-worms; but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and<br />great oneyers; such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner<br />than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than<br />pray:  and yet, zwounds, I lie; for they pray continually to their<br />saint, the Commonwealth; or, rather, not pray to her, but prey on<br />her, for they ride up and down on her, and make her their boots.<br /><br />CHAM.<br />What, the Commonwealth their boots? will she hold out water<br />in foul way?<br /><br />GADS.<br />She will, she will; justice hath liquor'd her. We steal as in a <br />castle, cock-sure; we have the receipt of fernseed,--we walk<br />invisible.<br /><br />CHAM.<br />Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night<br />than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.<br /><br />GADS.<br />Give me thy hand:  thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as<br />I am a true man.<br /><br /><br />CHAM.<br />Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.<br /><br />GADS.<br />Go to; homo is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler<br />bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell, you muddy knave.<br /><br />[Exeunt.]<br /><br /><br />Scene II. The Road by Gads-hill.<br /><br />[Enter Prince Henry and Pointz; Bardolph and Peto at<br />some distance.]<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Come, shelter, shelter:  I have remov'd Falstaff's horse,<br />and he frets like a gumm'd velvet.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Stand close.                        <br /><br />[They retire.]<br /><br />[Enter Falstaff.]<br /><br />FAL.<br />Pointz!

If I travel but<br />four foot by the squire further a-foot, I shall break my wind.<br />Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I 'scape<br />hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company hourly<br />any time this two-and-twenty year, and yet I am bewitch'd with the<br />rogue's company. If the rascal have not given me medicines to make<br />me love him, I'll be hang'd; it could not be else:  I have drunk<br />medicines.--<br />Pointz!--Hal!--a plague upon you both!--Bardolph!--Peto!--I'll<br />starve, ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere not as good a deed as<br />drink, to turn true man, and to leave these rogues, I am the veriest<br />varlet that ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven ground<br />is threescore and ten miles a-foot with me; and the stony-hearted<br />villains know it well enough:  a plague upon't, when thieves cannot<br />be true one to another!<br />[They whistle.] Whew!--A plague upon you all! Give me<br />my horse, you rogues; give me my horse, and be hang'd!<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />[Coming forward.] Peace! lie down; lay thine ear close to the<br />ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of travellers.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? 'Sblood, I'll<br />not bear mine own flesh so far a-foot again for all the coin in thy<br />father's exchequer.

If I be<br />ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I have not ballads made on you<br />all, and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison.<br />When a jest is so forward, and a-foot too, I hate it.<br /><br />[Enter Gadshill.]<br /><br />GADS.<br />Stand!<br /><br />FAL.<br />So I do, against my will.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice.<br /><br />[Comes forward with Bardolph and Peto.]<br /><br />BARD.  <br />What news?<br /><br />GADS.<br />Case ye, case ye; on with your visards:  there's money of<br />the King's coming down the hill; 'tis going to the King's<br />exchequer.<br /><br />FAL.<br />You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the King's tavern.<br /><br />GADS.<br />There's enough to make us all.<br /><br />FAL.<br />To be hang'd.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane; Ned<br />Pointz and I will walk lower; if they 'scape from your<br />encounter, then they light on us.<br /><br />PETO.<br />How many be there of them?<br /><br />GADS.<br />Some eight or ten.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Zwounds, will they not rob us?<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?<br /><br />FAL.<br />Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather; but yet<br />no coward, Hal.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Well, we leave that to the proof.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:  when thou <br />need'st him, there thou shalt find him. Farewell, and stand fast.<br /><br />FAL.<br />Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hang'd.<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />[aside to POINTZ.] Ned, where are our disguises?<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />[aside to PRINCE HENRY.] Here, hard by:  stand close.<br /><br />[Exeunt Prince and Pointz.]<br /><br />FAL.<br />Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:  every man<br />to his business.<br /><br />[Enter Travellers.]<br /><br />FIRST TRAVELLER.<br />Come, neighbour:<br />The boy shall lead our horses down the hill;<br />We'll walk a-foot awhile and ease our legs.<br /><br />FALS, GADS., &amp;C.<br />Stand!<br /><br />SECOND TRAVELLER.<br />Jesu bless us!<br /><br />FAL.<br />Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats. Ah,<br />whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they hate us youth:<br />down with them; fleece them.<br /><br />FIRST TRAVELLER.<br />O, we're undone, both we and ours for ever!<br /><br /><br />FAL.<br />Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye fat chuffs;<br />I would your store were here! On, bacons on! What, ye knaves!<br />young men must live. You are grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure<br />ye, i'faith.<br /><br />[Exeunt Fals., Gads., &amp;c., driving the Travellers out.]<br /><br />[Re-enter Prince Henry and Pointz, in buckram suits.]<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />The thieves have bound the true men. Now, could thou and I rob <br />the thieves, and go merrily to London, it would be argument for a<br />week, laughter for a month, and a good jest for ever.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Stand close:  I hear them coming.<br /><br />[They retire.]<br /><br />[Re-enter Falstaff, Gadshill, Bardolph, and Peto.]<br /><br />FAL.<br />Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day.<br />An the Prince and Pointz be not two arrant cowards, there's no<br />equity stirring:  there's no more valour in that Pointz than in a<br /><br />wild duck.<br /><br />[As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon them.] <br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Your money!<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Villains!<br /><br />[Falstaff, after a blow or two, and the others run away, leaving <br />the booty behind them.]<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:<br />The thieves are scatter'd, and possess'd with fear<br />So strongly that they dare not meet each other;<br />Each takes his fellow for an officer.<br />Away, good Ned. Fat Falstaff sweats to death,<br />And lards the lean earth as he walks along:<br />Were't not for laughing, I should pity him.<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />How the rogue roar'd!<br /><br />[Exeunt.]<br /><br /><br />Scene III. Warkworth.  A Room in the Castle.<br /><br />[Enter Hotspur, reading a letter.]<br /><br />HOT.<br />--But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented to<br />be there, in respect of the love I bear your House.--He could be<br />contented; why is he not, then? In respect of the love he bears<br />our House!--he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than he<br />loves our house. Let me see some more. The purpose you undertake<br />is dangerous;--Why, that's certain:  'tis dangerous to take a cold,<br />to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle,<br />danger, we pluck this flower, safety. The purpose you undertake is<br />dangerous; the friends you have named uncertain; the time itself<br />unsorted; and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so<br />great an opposition.--<br />Say you so, say you so?  I say unto you again, you are a shallow,<br />cowardly hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,<br />our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our friends true and<br />constant: a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an<br />excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is<br />this! Why, my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course<br />of the action. Zwounds! an I were now by this rascal, I could brain<br />him with his lady's fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and<br />myself? Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen Glendower? <br />is there not, besides, the Douglas? have I not all their letters to<br />meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month? and are they not<br />some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an<br />infidel! Ha! you shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and cold<br />heart, will he to the King, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I<br />could divide myself, and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of<br />skimm'd milk with so honourable an action!<br />Hang him! let him tell the King:  we are prepared. I will set<br />forward to-night.--<br /><br />[Enter Lady Percy.]<br /><br />How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.<br /><br /><br />LADY. <br />O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?<br />For what offence have I this fortnight been<br />A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?<br />Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee<br />Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?<br />Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,<br />And start so often when thou sitt'st alone?<br />Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;<br />And given my treasures and my rights of thee<br />To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy?<br />In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,<br />And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;<br />Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;<br />Cry Courage! to the field!  And thou hast talk'd<br />Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,<br />Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,<br />Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,<br />Of prisoners ransomed, and of soldiers slain,<br />And all the 'currents of a heady fight.<br />Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,<br />And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,<br />That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow,<br />Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;<br />And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,<br />Such as we see when men restrain their breath<br />On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?<br />Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,<br />And I must know it, else he loves me not.<br /><br />HOT.<br />What, ho!<br /><br />[Enter a Servant.]<br /><br />Is Gilliams with the packet gone?<br /><br />SERV.<br />He is, my lord, an hour ago.<br /><br />HOT.<br />Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?<br /><br />SERV.<br />One horse, my lord, he brought even now.<br /><br />HOT.<br />What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?<br /><br />SERV.<br />It is, my lord.<br /><br />HOT.<br />That roan shall be my throne.<br />Well, I will back him straight:  O esperance!--<br />Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.<br /><br />[Exit Servant.]<br /><br />LADY.<br />But hear you, my lord.<br /><br />HOT.<br />What say'st thou, my lady?  <br /><br />LADY.<br />What is it carries you away?<br /><br />HOT.<br />Why, my horse, my love, my horse.<br /><br />LADY.<br />Out, you mad-headed ape!<br />A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen<br />As you are toss'd with. In faith,<br />I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.<br />I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir<br />About his title, and hath sent for you<br />To line his enterprise:  but if you go,--<br /><br />HOT.<br />So far a-foot, I shall be weary, love.<br /><br />LADY.<br />Come, come, you paraquito, answer me<br />Directly to this question that I ask:<br />In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,<br />An if thou wilt not tell me true.<br /><br />HOT.<br />Away,<br />Away, you trifler! Love? I love thee not,<br />I care not for thee, Kate:  this is no world<br />To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:<br />We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,<br />And pass them current too.--Gods me, my horse!--<br />What say'st thou, Kate? what wouldst thou have with me?<br /><br />LADY.<br />Do you not love me? do you not indeed?<br />Well, do not, then; for, since you love me not,<br />I will not love myself. Do you not love me?<br />Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.<br /><br />HOT.<br />Come, wilt thou see me ride?<br />And when I am o' horseback, I will swear<br />I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;<br />I must not have you henceforth question me<br />Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:<br />Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,<br />This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.<br />I know you wise; but yet no further wise<br />Than Harry Percy's wife; constant you are;<br />But yet a woman:  and, for secrecy,<br />No lady closer; for I well believe<br />Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;<br />And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.<br /><br />LADY.<br />How! so far?<br /><br />HOT.<br />Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:  <br />Whither I go, thither shall you go too;<br />To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.<br />Will this content you, Kate?<br /><br />LADY.<br />It must of force.<br /><br />[Exeunt.]<br /><br /><br />Scene IV. Eastcheap. A Room in the Boar's-Head Tavern.<br /><br />[Enter Prince Henry.]<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />Ned, pr'ythee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy<br />hand to laugh a little.<br /><br />[Enter Pointz.]<br /><br />POINTZ.<br />Where hast been, Hal?<br /><br />PRINCE.<br />With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore <br />hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string of humility. <br />Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can call <br />them all by their Christian names, as, Tom, Dick, and Francis. <br />They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but <br />Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy; and tell me flatly <br />I am no proud Jack, like Falstaff, but a corinthian, a lad of mettle, <br />a good boy,--by the Lord, so they call me;--and, when I am King <br />of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They <br />call drinking deep, dying scarlet; and, when you breathe in your <br />watering, they cry hem! and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am <br />so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with <br />any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou <br />hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in this action.
