Upgrading procedures

Upgrading between 0.9 and 0.98
===============================

From postgresql 8.2 to 8.3
---------------------------
co-ment 0.9 was using Postgresql 8.2 and co-ment 1.0 is using Postgresql 8.3

One of the key differences between Postgresql 8.2 and 8.3 is the inclusion of the full text search utilities into the core.

Here is the recommended upgrade procedure :

1. Clean Postgresql 8.2 specifics in your previous installation:
-- execute this on any previous co-ment installation
DROP TRIGGER tsvectorupdate_cm_textversion ON cm_textversion;
DROP INDEX idxFTI_idx;
ALTER TABLE cm_textversion DROP COLUMN idxFTI;
DROP TABLE pg_ts_dict;
 
2. Upgrade from Postgresql 8.2 to 8.3 (you might want to look into pg_upgradecluster)

3. Make sure you're using co-ment 0.98 and restart the webserver

That should be it!

A syncdb is needed
--------------------
New tables where introduced in the 0.98 release, a simple 'python manage.py syncdb' should be all what's needed to create and configure them.


Upgrading between 0.98 and 0.99
===============================

This is only a bug fix release, no particular upgrade should be required.
(Make sure your settings.py has a OPENID = False line in it)
